    hmm so we want to make a portal system
    how can we accomplish this goal ?
    - " 3 portal system "
    what ?
    - " preview, in and out "
    they're the same ?
    - "not really preview is to show only in is to check collision and out is to determine out source"
    are there only one portal per ?
    - "yah"
    how are we gonna make sure there are only one portal available in the map ?
    -"Hmm i'm thinking about using static to ensure its uniqueness"
    How are we gonna initialize it then ?
    -"let's just use a start point for map"
    So how about the out part
    -"Thinking about the value of the portal"
    Value ?
    -" Each portal has value that determine its face position right
    2. LEFT
    3.UP
    4.RIGHT
    5.DOWN
    "
    I see, so how are we gonna move the portal, or create a new instance of it and delete the other ?
    -" Hmm we use instance to move it "
    So the portal has to have a fixed position each map ?
    -" Yeah that's the down side of this game"
    So Shall we make it ?
    -"Let's make a list of what we have to do first"
    UH huh which portal will be the easiest one to make all
    -"preview right ?"
    hmmm, we shall see
    waiitttttt, we have to remake the InvisibleBLock thing ?????
    -"Yeah it's pretty stupid as it was"
    Geh...
    We gonna use invisibleBlock as a frame for our portal ???
    -"Guess so..."
    Waddya mean ?
    "Yeah we gonna do it"
    "Alright i set up the type of the face thing"
    What's next
    "Hit make portal"
    preview first ?
    "Yah"

   -5/2
   Hey
   "Hello"
   So what are we going to do today
   "We are making the objective of the game!"
   Which is ?
   "The coin System"
   What is the plan ?
   "Make the coin appear randomly after being picked up ? "
   The wall seems like a waste of space right
   "Yah so we will make it random(700) + 50 right "
   Agree
   "I like doing this, its like i'm writing out everything for a friend which compensate for my lack of friends lol"
   K buddy
   And then what do we do to make the coin picking stuff seems rewarding ?
   "Hmm"
   "Wanna try out the drawing font thing ?"
   You do it
   "Kay.."
